# QT_assignment_Akanksha
A simple text editor with bold, subscript and superscript fuctionalities.
I have added **bold**/unbold and subscript/superscript functionalities and a about me section.

HOW TO RUN
- Open the project in Qt Creater(qpad.pro)
- build and run

ISSUES
- The subscript and superscript functionalities are slightly flawed.
- The bold/unbold function can also be improved but it works correctly.

FEATURES
- New file
- Open file
- Save file
- save as 
- Copy, cut, paste, undo, redo
- Bold/Unbold
- Subscript/ Superscript
- An About me dialog box
